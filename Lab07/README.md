1. In lab we combined out knowledge of state and event driven code to develope our own FSMs. By utilizing FSMs we are able to allow for change within a system by using events to change in between states. 

2. To do this lab, I went through a lot of planning to map out each section. I began with reading the lab manual 2 times as usual. Using Pseudocode, I then wrote out how each transition or state would look like. After mapping out each section and transition, I began writing code. Throughout the process I kept locating errors and needing to find better methods to go about what I wanted it to do. Never the less I kept getting issues when testing and getting the inevitable headache. I probably spent more time debugging and going through my state machines than I did writing the code. FSM are never as simple as they are when panning. 

3. After getting it working with the extra credit I spent a large bulk of 4 days working on the lab. The last day was spent on editing small pieces and minor debugs. This was my favorite lab as thinking about the state machnine and getting it to work was very satisfying. I felt like I was actually making something this lab.
