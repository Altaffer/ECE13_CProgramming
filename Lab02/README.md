1. with "scanf(" ");" the output would be the option for user input and once there was an input, the program will finish. This is because scanf allows for user input even if it is empty.

2. If there was a printf or scanf statement inside of the math functions there will be no way to return the mathematical result and printf or scanf statements. This will be useful to avoid bugs. It also allows for better separation in the program so that the function can be more versitile.
