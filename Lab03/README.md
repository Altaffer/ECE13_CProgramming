Programmer: Luca Altaffer taltaffe@ucsc.edu

1. In this lab we made our own library for matrix opperations and tested their correctness. This lab was important because it taught us to use nested for loops, create functions in a separate file, and most importantly create a creative test harness. 

2. Before starting this lab I spent a lot of time designing pseudocode. Because of this, creating the functions and test harness came really quickly as I knew what I was gonna do and how to do it before I even touched the computer. This worked very well and made debugging easier. I sometimes got errors in teh inverse function when using the submatrix function because the size of matrix it returned was smaller than a 3x3. I worked by myself and I don't think I would approach it differently. If anything, I would have started earlier. 

3. I think I spent around 4 hours on pseudocode and another 4-5 hours writing the code itself. There wasn't anything particularly that I enjoyed about it, I in fact found it very tedious, but for an introductory programming class I can see why it would have value. I think the hardest part was debugging the submatrix function as I had an issue there that took me an hour or 2 to find. I didn't look at the grading distribution. I think the lab manual had a lot of information and was helpful.
