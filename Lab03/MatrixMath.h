 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file implements a basic 3x3 matrix math library. Basic matrix operations are provided along
 * with the matrix inverse function (though that function cannot handle singular matrices).
 *
 * Matrices are defined in row-major order, so that the matrix:
 *   0 1 2
 *   3 4 5
 *   6 7 8
 * is represented by the array `float mat[3][3] = {{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}};`.

/**
 * FP_DELTA defines the tolerance for testing equality for floating-point numbers. 
 * Used within MatrixEquals() 
 * Also used to compare scalar return values, such as the result of MatrixTrace().
