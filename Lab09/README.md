Our AI should beat the AI of the Staff learnly 50% of the time. I collobrated on this lab with Nick where he did half of the lab and I did the other half. We eneded up helping eaching write our respective test scripts as a means to not give each other bad code. While we spoke with each otehr remotely, on the last day we met in person and conected our micro controllers together.
In this lab, we were tasked to make our own version of the game battle ship. Split into 5 functional files, the main, Agent, Field, Message, Negotiate. The main, put everything together and makes everything work cohesively for teh game to run. Agent was the decision making and transition to the different game states file. Field was all about the functionality of the game field and how the game board and ships could be organized. Messgae was about the communication of the micro controlers and finally negotiate decides order and detects cheating. 
What worked well was our organization and comunication. We spoke frequently and are in the same research lab so it was easy to coordinate things. I think a good strategy is to firstly work with someone you get along with and frequently communicate with them. What didn't work well was our ability to deal with the lab structure. When we met in person, both of us were confident in our codes ability to function on its own but putting it together was a problem. If we had better anticipated this and managed our time better we would have done better. This being said with both of our busy schedules, it may have been hard to time manage better. 
Beside improving my technical skills in this lab, what I really learned more than anything is how to split up a coding project in half. Never before have I split one project in half like this. It felt awkward and like things were missing and communicating effecticly was very helpful for our success. 
I enjoyed the game design aspect of it. It gave the lab a purpose and a visual interactable goal. For the future I would change the lab's difficulty and how partners interact. I think instead of having both partners hold half of the project, the partners have separate projects that can build and function on its own but the last step of the lab requires partner interaction and communication.
