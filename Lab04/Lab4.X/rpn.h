/* RPN_Evaluate() parses and evaluates a string that contains

 * @param:  result - a pointer to a double that will be modified to contain
 *          the return value of the rpn expression.
 * @return: error - if the rpn expression is invalid, 
 *          an appropriate rpn_error value is returned.

 * RPN_Evaluate supports the following basic arithmetic operations:
 *   + : addition
 *   - : subtraction
 *   * : multiplication
 *   / : division
 * Numeric tokens can be positive or negative, and can be integers or 
 * decimal floats.  RPN_Evaluate should be able to handle strings of

 * This function should read through an array of characters, checking for backspace characters.

 * (if such a character exists), and shifts all subsequent characters as appropriate.
 * @param string_to_modify The string that will be processed for backspaces. 
 *        This string is modified "in place", so it is both an input and an output to the function.
 * @return Returns the size of the resulting string in "string_to_modify".

 * strings with more backspaces than characters. It should be able to handle strings of at least 255 length.
