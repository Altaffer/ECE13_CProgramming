1. In this lab we learned how to use pointers as a way to conserve memory and reference things more effectively. We also learned how to manipulate strings.

2. Liek most labs, I started reading the lab manual. However this time, I did not spend too much time writing pseudo code and taking notes. This was ultimately my downfall on this lab as it took me a lot longer to figure out parts of this lab, especially the rpn parts. In the end I ran out of time to take into account more corner cases as in negative numbers and decimals. If I were to go back, I would have prepped better.

3. I didn't count my hours spent on this lab, but it was more than the other labs. While I was able to get it working, I was unable to accont for all the corner cases I would have liked and ran out of time. I have some commented out code in the rpn file which shows my attempts at figuring out corner cases for negative and float values. unfortunaletly I was unabe to get it integrated in time. This being said otehr basic opperations worked fine. I think the lab manual should have covered more of how to do the rpn functions. There were functions and strategies that could have been implemented that would have been nice to know about like atof(). However I did appreciate the table that helped structure how we pop and push things inside of rpn.c.
