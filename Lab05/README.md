Was helped by roomate to create tests

1. Insertion sort is faster. This follows the hunch I had, but I did not have an expectation at the time.

2. In this lab we learned about linked lists and mroe about pointers. We then created two different sorting algorithms and tested to see which was more effective.

3. I started the lab by reading the lab manual and understanding what was being asked of me. I then proceeded by making all the functions in LinkedList.c. I followed that up by making a test script for all of the functions. After verifying that they work, I completed sort.c. WHile this strategy worked well, I did spend some time debugging and making sure everything worked. Unfortunately I only had 3 days to complete this lab so I had to give it all my focus. I did not work with other students in the class but had suggestions on how to debug and test from my roommate.

4. I spent 3 days working on this lab. Everything worked well and as intended except the Inserstion sort function which was not working on MPLab but it did on another c compiler that I used to test. There wasn't anything that I particularly liked or disliked but it was good things to learn about.
