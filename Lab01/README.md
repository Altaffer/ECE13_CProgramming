*END OF LAB QUESTIONS
*/
1. In this lab we became aquainted with MPLAB x IDE, the pic32, and a general idea of how to program in C. Begining with a simple "Hello World" program we coded on MPLAB x to communicate with teh uno32 microcontroller. Following this part we then learned how to locate the data produced after compiling the code in MPLAB x and how to create breakpoints to better analyze the data. Part 2 had us toying with printf commands and how to manipulate print structures. Finally, part 3 had us interacting with the OLED. 
2. Most of my dificulty on the lab was attempting to download MPLAB x on 2 separate linux machines.For some reasons I had several issues downloading the program and each machine had different issues. At the end I ended up working on a windows machine and I have to figure out my issues on Linux. If someone reading this can give me any experience with Linux and can help me debug please contact me at taltaffe@ucsc.edu. Thank you
3. I believe there were some inconsistencies with the lab manual. Specifically with part 1 there was a reference to a line number that was very off to the template by nearly 60 lines. This made this part of the lab somewhat confusing during part 1 but after continuing with the instructions it was clear that the manual had a mistake. Otherwise the manual was very clear.
